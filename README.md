ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GiovanniColonni
I am a computer science engineer with a specialization in cloud computing.
I have a strong background in web development, particularly using JavaScript and Python, and I am also well-versed in using Google Cloud.
In addition to my work as a developer, I also have experience as a DevOps engineer in a consultancy.
I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and techniques, and am particularly interested in the exciting world 
of web3 and cryptocurrency.

As a hobby, I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and have a solid foundation in cyber security.
