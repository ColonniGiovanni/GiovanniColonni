ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GiovanniColonni and Welcome to my personal page!

I am a backend engineer with a passion for the emerging world of web3. With a background in backend engineering for an NFT marketplace startup, I have hands-on experience building decentralized applications and working with blockchain technologies.

During my time at the startup, I gained a deep understanding of the intricacies involved in building a reliable and scalable backend infrastructure. I worked closely with the frontend team to ensure seamless user experiences, and collaborated with designers and product managers to build features that met user needs.

In addition to my experience in backend engineering, I have also worked extensively in the automation and DevOps world. I understand the importance of deploying code quickly and efficiently, and have implemented automated testing and deployment pipelines that have saved valuable time and resources.

As a self-motivated and curious individual, I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the web3 world. I am excited about the potential of blockchain technologies to transform industries and am committed to building products that make a real difference.

Thank you for taking the time to read my profile. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience can contribute to your team.
